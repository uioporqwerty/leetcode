# Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
# two given nodes, p and q. If either node p or q does not exist in the tree,
# return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor
# of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)". A
# descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some
# leaf node.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of
# itself according to the definition of LCA.
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
# Output: null
# Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:Â Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes
# existence?
