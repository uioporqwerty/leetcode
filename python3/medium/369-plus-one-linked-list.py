#
# Given a non-negative integer represented as a linked list of digits, plus one
# to the integer.
# 
# The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of
# the list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [0]
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# The number represented by the linked list does not contain leading zeros
# except for the zero itself.Â
