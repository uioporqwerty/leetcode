#
# Given a Circular Linked List node, which is sorted in ascending order, write
# a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a
# sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in
# the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.
# 
# If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place
# to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain
# sorted.
# 
# If the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), you should create a new
# single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise,
# you should return the originally given node.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
# Output: [3,4,1,2]
# Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three
# elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to
# insert 2 into the list. The new node should be inserted between node 1 and
# node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should
# still return node 3.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The list is empty (given head isÂ null). We create a new single
# circular list and return the reference to that single node.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
# Output: [1,0]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
# -10^6 <= Node.val, insertVal <= 10^6
#
