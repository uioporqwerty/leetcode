# Testcase Example:  '["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]'
#
# Given a character array s, reverse the order of the words.
# 
# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will
# be separated by a single space.
# 
# Your code must solve the problemÂ in-place, i.e. without allocating extra
# space.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
# Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
# Example 2:
# Input: s = ["a"]
# Output: ["a"]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# s[i] is an English letter (uppercase or lowercase), digit, or space ' '.
# There is at least one word in s.
# s does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.
#

            i += 1
            j -= 1
        
        i, j = 0, 0

        while j < len(s):
            while j < len(s) and s[j] != ' ':
                j += 1
            r_i, r_j = i, j - 1
            while r_i < r_j:

                r_j -= 1
            j += 1
