# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing
# this:
# 
# 
# Collect all the leaf nodes.
# Remove all the leafÂ nodes.
# Repeat until the tree is empty.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
# Explanation:
# [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers
# since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are
# returned.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [[1]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        results = []
        
        if not root:
            return results

        def dfs(node: TreeNode):
            if not node:
                return -1
            
            height = max(dfs(node.left), dfs(node.right)) + 1

            if height >= len(results):
                results.append([])
            
            results[height].append(node.val)

            return height
        
        dfs(root)

        return results
