#
# Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both
# have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
# 
# You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list
# index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with
# no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
# ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
# ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
# Output: ["Shogun"]
# Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is
# "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
# ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
# Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
# ["KNN","KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
# Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: list1 = ["KFC"], list2 = ["KFC"]
# Output: ["KFC"]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
# 1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30
# list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
# All the stings of list1 are unique.
# All the stings of list2Â are unique.
#
